## Device Support

Currently we check [https://analytics.usa.gov/data/](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/) for which
OS/Browser that combinations are the most common.

This is strictly not a bad source since it is updated daily but is not representative of Swedish OS/Browser usages
towards public sector websites, thus, such a source if updated daily should be preferred over the current one.

| OS       | Browser | Supported |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| iOS      | Safari  | 🟡        |
| iOS      | Chrome  | 🟡        |
| Windows  | Chrome  | ✅        |
| Android  | Chrome  | 🟡        |
| Windows  | Edge    | ✅        |
