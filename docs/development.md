# Development Guidelines for the SAML IdP for BankID

-----

**Note:** All contributors to this project are expected to follow the guidelines stated in the [Contributing to the BankID SAML IdP](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

The BankID IdP backend is a Spring Boot application and the frontend is a Vue-application. It is 
expected that you are familiar with these frameworks before starting development activities.

## Obtaining the BankID IdP Source

The source for the project is located at [https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp) and you are free to clone the repository or create a 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

<a name="building-the-source"></a>
## Building the Source

If you want to deploy a BankID IdP and don't have to make any changes apart from configuration 
customizations of the UI (see [Customizing the BankID IdP UI](override.html#customizing-the-bankid-idp-ui)),
you don't have to build the BankID source. Instead, you can just download the [BankID jar from Maven
Central](artifacts.html).

> Note: Before you build you must ensure that you have Java, Maven and npm installed on your machine.

To build the BankID IdP with a built-in frontend application:

```bash
cd my-install-dir
mvn clean package
```

To build the BankID IdP without a built-in frontend application:

```bash
cd my-install-dir
mvn clean package -Dbackend-only
```

<a name="running-the-service-locally"></a>
## Running the Service Locally

To develop the service we recommend the use of the "local" profile.

In this mode the service will require two dependencies: 

- a configured [service provider](#saml-service-provider-for-local-test-and-development) (SP), and,
- a [local test instance of Redis](#local-redis-instance).

When the Redis instance has been started you should be able to start the BankID IdP-application with the "local" profile active. Next, start the [Test-SP](#saml-service-provider-for-local-test-and-development)
and send authentication requests.

To start the BankID IdP-application with the "local" profile the following environment variables
should be set to load the relevant properties.

```bash
BANKID_INSTALL_DIR=<root directory where you checked out the BankID repository>
SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT=${BANKID_INSTALL_DIR}/bankid-idp/env/local/developer.yml
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local
```

> Don't you have a test-BankID installed on your device? See [BankID and Sweden Connect Resources](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/bankid-sc-resources.html).

<a name="saml-service-provider-for-local-test-and-development"></a>
### SAML Service Provider for Local Test and Development

A pre-configured SAML Service Provider that can be used to send requests to the BankID IdP when
running under the "local" profile can be found at https://github.com/swedenconnect/test-my-eid.

Clone or fork this repository and start the "Test my eID"-application with the "local" profile active.

Point your browser to `https://localhost:9445/testmyeid/` and you should see something like:

![Test-my-eid](images/test-my-eid.png)

Click the "BankID (local)" option and a SAML request should be sent to the IdP.

> Not working? Well, you need to start the IdP application ...

<a name="local-redis-instance"></a>
### Local Redis Instance

When running with the local profile, there is a docker-compose file for Redis that works out of the box under the following path [bankid-idp/env/local/redis/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/bankid-idp/env/local/redis/docker-compose.yml).

To start Redis, simply run:

```
> docker compose -f ${CODE_ROOT}/bankid-idp/env/local/redis/docker-compose.yml up
```

<a name="local-redis-cluster-instance"></a>
### Local Redis Cluster Instance

There is an additional docker compose file that can be used if you wish to develop with a Redis cluster:

```
> docker compose -f ${CODE_ROOT}/bankid-idp/env/local/redis-cluster/docker-compose.yml up
```

**Note**: When running with this setup there is an additional profile `cluster` that should be used
which configures the cluster. You need both profiles to be active `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local,cluster`.

## Using Docker

**Building Docker image and pushing to registry:**

```bash
export DOCKER_REPO=yourdockerrepo:port
mvn clean install
mvn -f bankid-idp/bankid-idp jib:build
```

**Building, local Docker image only:**
Since MultiArch build is not supported locally, we need to limit the execution to a specific execution-id
```bash
export DOCKER_REPO=local
mvn clean install
mvn -f bankid-idp/bankid-idp jib:dockerBuild@local
```
