This page describes the audit event logging feature of the BankID IdP.

<a name="audit-configuration"></a>
## Audit Configuration

The [Configuration of the BankID SAML IdP](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/configuration.html) has a section about [Audit Logging Configuration](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/configuration.html#audit-logging-configuration). This chapter describes this
configuration in more detail.

The setting `bankid.audit.repository` should be set to any of the following values:

- `memory` - An in-memory audit event repository is used. The events can be accessed via Spring Boot Actuator's `auditevents` endpoint. Using the defaults from [application.yml](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/bankid-idp/src/main/resources/application.yml) this URL would then be `https://<yourdomain>:8444/actuator/auditevents`. This is the default if no setting is provided.

- `redislist` - Events are persisted using a Redis List. In order for this setting to function, Redis must also have been configured, see [Redis Configuration](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/configuration.html#redis-configuration). Also see [RedisListAuditEventRepository](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/bankid-idp/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/bankid/idp/audit/RedisListAuditEventRepository.java) for details.

- `redistimeseries` - Events are persisted using the Redis Time series-feature. In order for this setting to function, Redis must also have been configured, see [Redis Configuration](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/configuration.html#redis-configuration). Also see [RedisTimeSeriesAuditEventRepository](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/bankid-idp/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/bankid/idp/audit/RedisTimeSeriesAuditEventRepository.java) for details.

- `other` - This setting should be assigned if you extend the BankID SAML IdP and wants to provide a audit repository of your own. See [Providing a Custom Audit Event Repository](#providing-a-custom-audit-event-repository) below.

By assigning the setting `bankid.audit.log-file` the BankID IdP Auditing feature will also write audit logs to file. Each line in this file will contain an audit event in JSON format.

> The log file feature will use a rolling date handler, meaning that for each day a new log file is created and the previous log file is renamed to `<logfile>-<date>.log`.

Finally, using the `bankid.audit.supported-events` setting it is also possible to exclude certain events from being stored/written. See all events below.

<a name="providing-a-custom-audit-event-repository"></a>
## Providing a Custom Audit Event Repository

If you extend the BankID SAML IdP you can provide your own implementation of the audit event repository. For example, you may want to store audit events in a database.

Your custom implementation should extend the [AbstractBankIdAuditEventRepository](https://github.com/swedenconnect/bankid-saml-idp/blob/main/bankid-idp/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/bankid/idp/audit/AbstractBankIdAuditEventRepository.java) class if you want to keep the support for
file logging and filtering of events. If that is not relevant for you, you may instead implement Spring's 
[AuditEventRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/actuate/audit/AuditEventRepository.html).

Next, you need a Spring configuration class to create your bean. The example below illustrates this class:

```
@Configuration
@EnableConfigurationProperties(BankIdConfigurationProperties.class)
public class CustomAuditRepositoryConfiguration {

  private final BankIdConfigurationProperties.AuditConfiguration config;

  public CustomAuditRepositoryConfiguration(final BankIdConfigurationProperties properties) {
    this.config = Objects.requireNonNull(properties, "properties must not be null").getAudit();
  }

  @Bean
  @ConditionalOnProperty(value = "bankid.audit.repository", havingValue = "other", matchIfMissing = false)
  AuditEventRepository customAuditRepository(final AuditEventMapper mapper) throws IOException {
    return new MyCustomAuditEventRepository(this.config.getLogFile(), mapper,
      this.config.getSupportedEvents());
  }

}

```

Finally, don't forget to set `bankid.audit.repository` to `other` to activate your extension.

These fields identify the requesting entity and the ID of the authentication request when the user authenticated. The `authn-instant` (see above) will in these cases be set to this instant. | SsoInfo                                            |
