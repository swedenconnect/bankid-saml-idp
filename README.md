A SAML Identity Provider for BankID. 

-----

## About

This repository comprises of a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) for BankID. The IdP is built according
to the [Swedish eID Framework](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/technical-framework/) and may be
used within the [Sweden Connect Federation](https://www.swedenconnect.se).

The BankID IdP uses the [SAML IdP Spring Boot starter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/saml-identity-provider) project, so most of the SAML-specific code resides in that repository.

The repository also contains a Java library implementing the [BankID Relying Party API](https://www.bankid.com/utvecklare/guider/teknisk-integrationsguide).

## Documentation

Visit the [BankID SAML IdP Documentation](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/bankid-saml-idp/) to learn how
to customize, extend, and build and deploy the application.

You may also want to read the [Sweden Connect eID Framework](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/technical-framework/) specifications and [BankID Development Guides](https://www.bankid.com/utvecklare/guider).
